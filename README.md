## Bonus for Linux users
One of the way to run bot in the background of the OS.
(It's written by Ubuntu 20.04 user.)

1. Clone the repo in to `/var` directory.
2. Create `www` user with correct permissions to read and execute existing files and create files in `files` and `config` directories.
3. Create a service config file `/etc/systemd/system/discordbot.service`, with that content:

```
[Unit]
Description=Discord BOT service
After=network.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=0

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=1
User=www
WorkingDirectory=/var/Collector_bot
ExecStart=python3 /var/Collector_bot/main.py
SyslogIdentifier=DiscorBOT

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

4. Run commands:
```sh
sudo systemctl enable discordbot.service
sudo systemctl start discordbot.service
sudo systemctl status discordbot.service
```

5. And if you want to stop the bot:
```sh
sudo systemctl stop discordbot.service
```
